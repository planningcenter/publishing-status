# ErrorView

`ErrorView` can be used to display a normalized error text.

<Preview>
  <Story name="default">
    <PublishingStatus.ErrorView />
  </Story>
</Preview>

It defers to `as` and `children` props but there's no practical reason to use it over your own component with custom error messaging.
