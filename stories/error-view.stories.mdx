## Don't have an error boundary?

If you don't already have an error boundary:

1. You use this as an excuse to make on that integrates with your error repotoring
1. You can use the included `ErrorBoundary` component, which shows this error by default

<Preview>
  <Story name="ErrorBoundary">
    <PublishingStatus.ErrorBoundary>
      <PublishingStatus.ViewSwitch />
    </PublishingStatus.ErrorBoundary>
  </Story>
</Preview>
